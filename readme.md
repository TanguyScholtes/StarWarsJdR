## About Star Wars JdR

Star Wars JdR is a homemade paper roleplaying game system based on the D20 System. As its name hints, this RPG takes place in the wonderfully rich universe of Star Wars.
The gaming system is homemade, but if you're familiar with games (videogames or paper RPG) based on the D20 System such as Pathfinder, D&D or even some Star Wars videogames like Knights of the Old Republic, you'll feel just at home.  
For those of you that are no familiar with this kind of system, don't worry : the rules were made to be quite simple and are available [right here](http://tanguyscholtes.be/StarWarsJDR/index.php?page=start). But keep in mind that the best way to get the rules is to expercience them while playing.

## Classes

Star Wars JdR features 4 basic classes : Soldier, Scout, Scoundrel and Force User.  
Each of these classes has specific traits and abilities that help you design a unique character as you play. This uniqueness is reinforced by the traits you'll be able to chose as your character get more experienced : you decide what you take among more than 40 traits that will get more and more powerful. Forge your character exactly as you want it to be !

## Races

Even if Humans are the most widespread of the races across the galaxy, you're far from having to play one. More than 30 races are at your disposal, each with its own upsides ad downsides, allowing you to play the character of your dreams !

## Alignement

In a galaxy at war, you have to pick a side, be it the Galactic Republic, the Sith Empire or even your own side. But your side in the war doesn't always determine what you are and what you become.  
In Star Wars JdR, you start either attuned to the Light Side, the Dark Side or neither (sometimes described as "Neutral" or "Grey"). But each action you undertake has consequences, and your alignement will reflect if those actions are good or bad. A pure Jedi can become corrupted by the Dark Side if he quenches his bloodthirst and kill people he didn't have to. All the same, a Dark Lord of the Siths can come back to the Light if he gets soft and spare ennemies.  
This everchanging alignement interferes with the powers a Force User can unleash. A Force User attuned to the Light Side will have troubles using powers of the Dark Side, butt will see his Light Side powers much easier to use as he is attuned to them. And the opposite is true as well.  
You chose your own path : will you be a paragon of Light fighting for peace and justice in the galaxy, or will you succumb to the Dark Side of the Force and rule the galaxy by crushing everything in your way ?
